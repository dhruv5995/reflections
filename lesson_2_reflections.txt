What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When we initialise a repository .git file is created which will contain all the metadata regarding the files in that repository. We need to do it because git can not track changes without initialising the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

We may want to include seleccted files for a commit. Git gives us control for that through staging area. Files are added from working directory to staging area and then the commits are made in the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

We use the git add, git diff and git diff --staged to make sure we have one commit per logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches are helpful when we want to make a change but still want to keep the master node intact. This is useful when we want to do some experimentation or want to add a language feature.
