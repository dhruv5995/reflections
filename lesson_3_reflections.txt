When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I am using more than 1 work stations or when I am working in a group project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Automatic changes may result in inadvertant changes in the offline repository which is undesirable.
